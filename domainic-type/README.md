A flexible type validation system for Ruby, offering composable, readable type constraints with elegant error messages.

Stop wrestling with complex type validations and unclear error messages. Domainic::Type brings type validation to Ruby
that is both powerful and delightful to use. Build composable type constraints with crystal-clear error messages that
actually tell you what went wrong. From simple type checks to complex collection validations, make your types work for
you, not against you!
