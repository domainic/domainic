      # A constraint that combines multiple constraints with logical OR behavior.
      #
      # The OrConstraint validates that a value satisfies at least one of its provided constraints,
      # implementing logical OR behavior. This enables validation rules like "must be either a
      # string or a symbol" or "must be nil or a positive number".
      #
      # Key features:
      # - Combines multiple constraints with OR logic
      # - Short-circuits on first passing constraint
      # - Provides clear error messages listing all failed attempts
      # - Supports incremental constraint addition
      #
      # @example Validating a value is either a String or Symbol
      #   string_constraint = StringConstraint.new(:self)
      #   symbol_constraint = SymbolConstraint.new(:self)
      #   string_or_symbol = OrConstraint.new(:self, [string_constraint, symbol_constraint])
      #
      #   string_or_symbol.satisfied?("test")  # => true
      #   string_or_symbol.satisfied?(:test)   # => true
      #   string_or_symbol.satisfied?(123)     # => false
