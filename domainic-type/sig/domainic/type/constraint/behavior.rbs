    module Constraint
      # A module providing core functionality for implementing type constraints.
      #
      # The Behavior module serves as the foundation for all type constraints in the Domainic::Type system.
      # It provides a flexible interface for defining how values should be constrained, supporting both
      # simple type checking and complex validation rules.
      #
      # Key features include:
      # - Flexible value access through configurable accessors
      # - Support for custom validation logic
      # - Coercion hooks for both actual and expected values
      # - Detailed failure reporting
      # - Type-aware error messages
      #
      # @abstract Implementing classes must override {#satisfies_constraint?} to define their specific
      #   constraint logic.
      #
      # @example Implementing a basic numeric constraint
      #   class GreaterThanConstraint
      #     include Domainic::Type::Constraint::Behavior
      #
      #     def description
      #       "greater than #{@expected}"
      #     end
      #
      #     def violation_description
      #       @actual.to_s
      #     end

      #     def satisfies_constraint?
      #       @actual > @expected
      #     end
      #
      #     def validate_expectation!(expectation)
      #       raise ArgumentError, 'Expected value must be numeric' unless expectation.is_a?(Numeric)
      #     end
