      # A factory class responsible for dynamically loading and resolving constraint types.
      #
      # The Resolver handles the dynamic loading and instantiation of constraint classes based on
      # their type symbols. It manages the conversion of constraint type symbols (like :string or
      # :numeric) into their corresponding constraint classes (like StringConstraint or
      # NumericConstraint).
      #
      # Key responsibilities:
      # - Converting constraint type symbols into file paths
      # - Loading constraint class files dynamically
      # - Resolving constraint class constants
      # - Providing clear error messages for unknown constraints
      #
      # @example Resolving a string constraint
      #   resolver = Resolver.new(:string)
      #   string_constraint_class = resolver.resolve! # => StringConstraint
      #
      # @example Resolving an unknown constraint
      #   resolver = Resolver.new(:unknown)
      #   resolver.resolve! # raises ArgumentError: Unknown constraint: unknown
