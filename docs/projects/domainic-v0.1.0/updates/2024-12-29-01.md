# Announcing Domainic::Command v0.1.0! ðŸŽ‰

We're excited to announce the release of Domainic::Command v0.1.0, the latest addition to the Domainic suite of tools
for domain-driven design in Ruby!

## What is Domainic::Command

Domainic::Command brings the Command pattern to Ruby in a way that feels natural and expressive. It provides type-safe,
self-documenting business operations with standardized error handling and composable workflows.

Here's a quick look at what you can do:

```ruby
class CreateUser
  extend Domainic::Type::Definitions
  include Domainic::Command

  # Type-safe inputs with clear validation
  argument :email, _EmailAddress, required: true
  argument :password, _String.having_min_length(8), required: true

  # Explicit outputs that document expectations
  output :user, _Instance.of(User), required: true
  output :auth_token, _String

  def execute
    user = User.create!(
      email: context.email,
      password: context.password
    )

    context.user = user
    context.auth_token = generate_token(user)
  end
end

# Use it anywhere!
result = CreateUser.call(email: "user@example.com", password: "secret123")

if result.successful?
  puts "Created user #{result.user.email}"
else
  puts "Failed: #{result.errors.full_messages.join(', ')}"
end
```

## Key Features

* **Type-Safe Arguments**: Define and validate input parameters with clear type constraints
* **Explicit Outputs**: Specify expected return values and their requirements
* **Standardized Error Handling**: Consistent error reporting with detailed failure information
* **Thread Safety**: Built-in thread safety for class definition and execution
* **Command Composition**: Build complex workflows by combining simpler commands
* **Self-Documenting**: Generate clear documentation from your command definitions
* **Framework Agnostic**: Use with any Ruby application (Rails, Sinatra, pure Ruby)

## Perfect for Every Context

Whether you're building a web application, CLI tool, or background job processor, Domainic::Command adapts to your
needs:

```ruby
# In Rails controllers
def create
  result = CreateUser.call(user_params)
  if result.successful?
    redirect_to user_path(result.user)
  else
    @errors = result.errors
    render :new
  end
end

# In CLI applications
def create_user
  result = CreateUser.call(options)
  exit result.status_code  # Unix exit codes!
end

# In background jobs
def perform(user_data)
  CreateUser.call!(user_data)
rescue Domainic::Command::ExecutionError => e
  notify_failure(e.result)
  raise  # Re-raise for retry
end
```

## Better with Domainic::Type

Domainic::Command works seamlessly with Domainic::Type to provide even stronger type safety and validation:

```ruby
class ProcessOrder
  extend Domainic::Type::Definitions
  include Domainic::Command

  argument :order_id, _UUID
  argument :payment_amount, _Float.being_positive
  argument :shipping_address, _Instance.of(Address)

  output :transaction, _Instance.of(Transaction)
  output :shipping_label, _String.matching(/^SHIP\d{12}$/)
end
```
