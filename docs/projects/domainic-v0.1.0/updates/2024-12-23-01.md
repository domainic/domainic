# Experiment Launch: Domainic::Type Alpha 3

We're excited to announce the experimental release of Domainic::Type! This marks our first public experiment in the
Domainic ecosystem, exploring flexible type validation with composable constraints.

## What's Being Tested

The experiment focuses on three key areas:

1. **Error Message Composition**
  * How well do error messages combine across multiple constraints?
  * Are messages clear and helpful when dealing with complex types?
  * Do nested type validations provide meaningful error context?

2. **Type System Completeness**
  * Current types include String, Integer, Float, Array, Hash, Symbol, Boolean, etc.
  * Looking for feedback on missing types and use cases
  * Testing type composition with unions, enums, and duck types

3. **Constraint System**
  * Rich set of built-in constraints for each type
  * Testing constraint composition and chaining
  * Seeking feedback on missing constraints and use cases

## Feedback Collection

All feedback will be gathered through GitHub issues. We've intentionally kept the barrier to feedback low * no templates
required, just share what you find! Key feedback areas:

* Error message clarity and usefulness
* Missing types or constraints
* Unexpected behaviors
* Creative workarounds
* Real-world use cases

## Documentation

The experiment is documented in the `docs/experiments/domainic-type-alpha-3` directory:

* README.md - Overview and quick start
* TROUBLESHOOTING.md - Common issues and solutions
* Examples and known issues docs to follow

## Next Steps

1. Release `domainic-type v0.1.0-alpha.3.0.0` to RubyGems
2. Monitor and gather feedback through GitHub issues
3. Iterate based on community input
4. Work toward a stable v0.1.0 release

## Getting Started

```ruby
gem 'domainic-type', '0.1.0-alpha.3.0.0'
```

We encourage everyone to experiment freely with the library. Chain constraints in creative ways, try complex type
compositions, and don't worry about breaking things * that's how we learn!

## Progress Tracking
