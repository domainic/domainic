# Domainic::Type Experiment Name Change

As we prepare for the next stage of the Domainic::Type experiment, we've made some updates to align the experiment name
with our planned version numbering.

## Alpha 3 is now 0.1.0 Alpha

The current Domainic::Type experiment, previously referred to as "Alpha 3", has been renamed to "0.1.0 Alpha". This
change sets the stage for our upcoming 0.1.0-alpha.4.0.0 release, which will include breaking changes.

Why the rename? A few reasons:

1. **Version Alignment**: "0.1.0 Alpha" makes it clear that this experiment is part of the 0.1.0 release cycle, heading
  toward a stable 0.1.0 release.

2. **Clear Progression**: The rename positions this as one step in a sequence of alpha experiments, rather than a single
  "Alpha 3" iteration.

3. **Semantic Numbering**: Following semantic versioning principles in our experiment names reinforces our commitment to
  a steady, predictable release cycle.

## What's Changing

* All references to "Alpha 3" in the documentation and code have been updated to "0.1.0 Alpha".
* Links to experiment documentation and associated GitHub pages now use the "domainic-type-0.1.0-alpha" nomenclature.
* The experiment's documentation directory has been renamed from `domainic-type-alpha-3` to `domainic-type-0.1.0-alpha`.

## What's Not Changing

* This rename does not affect the functionality or APIs of the current alpha release.
* Existing code that uses the current alpha release will continue to work without modification.

## Looking Ahead

With this naming update complete, we're excited to dive into the next phase of the Domainic::Type 0.1.0 Alpha
experiment. Here's a preview of what's coming in 0.1.0-alpha.4.0.0:

* [Experimental Feature] A powerful new way to compose type constraints
* [Breaking Change] Simplification of the custom type definition syntax
* [New Types] Support for ActiveModel-style attribute validations
* [Fixes] Resolution for several key issues uncovered in Alpha 3

Stay tuned for more details as we get closer to the release!
