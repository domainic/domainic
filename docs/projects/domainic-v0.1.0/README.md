## Short Description

The inaugural release of the Domainic ecosystem, establishing a comprehensive foundation for domain-driven design in
Ruby. This milestone introduces a complete set of tools for building robust, maintainable Ruby applications with a focus
on domain modeling, clean architecture, and type safety.

## Included Milestones

* [x] [domainic-attributer v0.1.0](https://github.com/domainic/domainic/milestone/4)
* [ ] [domainic-attributer v0.2.0](https://github.com/domainic/domainic/milestone/3)

* Comprehensive type validation and coercion
* Flexible attribute definition DSL
* Robust error handling

### Domainic::Boundary

* Explicit domain interfaces and boundaries
* Type-safe gateway pattern implementation
* Controlled cross-domain communication
* Clear architectural boundaries

### Domainic::Command

* First-class command objects for business operations
* Clear argument and return type specifications
* Standardized execution interface
* Rich command metadata

### Domainic::Type

## Release Highlights

* Complete domain-driven design toolkit
* Comprehensive type safety across all components
* Seamless integration between gems
* Clear, declarative APIs throughout
* Focus on developer experience and productivity

## Architectural Vision

This release introduces a cohesive ecosystem of Ruby libraries designed to support sophisticated domain modeling:

* Domainic::Attributer provides the foundation for building expressive, type-safe domain objects
* Domainic::Type enables precise definition of complex type constraints
* Domainic::Command encapsulates business operations as first-class objects
* Domainic::Boundary manages clean separation between domains

These components work together to enable robust, maintainable domain-driven applications while maintaining Ruby's
expressiveness.

## Future Roadmap

* Enhanced integration between components
* Advanced command composition patterns
* Extended type constraint capabilities
* Performance optimizations across the ecosystem
* Additional architectural patterns and tools

## Key Features

* Comprehensive type safety system

* Explicit domain interfaces
* Flexible validation strategies
* Advanced error handling

## Target Audience

* Ruby developers building complex domain models
* Teams implementing domain-driven design
* Developers seeking architectural clarity
* Projects requiring robust type safety
* Applications with complex domain interactions

## Release Philosophy

**Prioritizing**:

* Clean architecture
* Type safety
