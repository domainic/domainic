Domainic::Boundary is a sophisticated Ruby gem that provides a robust implementation of the Gateway pattern, designed to
create clear, controlled interfaces between different domains in complex software architectures. By establishing
explicit, type-safe communication channels, the gem helps manage the interactions between bounded contexts with
precision and clarity.

## Problem Statement

In large, complex software systems, domains often need to interact while maintaining clear boundaries and preventing
tight coupling. Existing communication patterns frequently lead to:

* Implicit dependencies
* Lack of clear interface contracts
* Difficult-to-maintain cross-domain interactions
* Reduced system modularity

## Solution

Domainic::Boundary introduces a declarative, type-safe gateway system that allows domains to define explicit, documented
interfaces for cross-domain communication. Each gateway provides a controlled, well-defined mechanism for interaction,
promoting loose coupling and clear architectural boundaries.

## Key Features

* **Explicit Domain Interfaces**
  * Type-safe parameter definitions
  * Documented method exposures
  * Clear input and output specifications
  * Controlled domain interactions
* **Gateway Definition**
  * Declarative interface creation
  * Command-based method exposures
  * Comprehensive parameter validation
  * Return type specifications
* **Interaction Control**
  * Explicit method exposures
  * Type checking for inputs and outputs
  * Metadata-rich interface descriptions

## Usage Examples

```ruby
module IdentityProvider
  class Gateway < Domainic::Boundary::Gateway
    expose :create_user do
      desc 'Create a new User with login and password'
      implementation CreateUserCommand, :call
      param :login, EmailAddress, "The User's Login", required: true
      param :password, String, "The User's Password", required: true
      param :role, Symbol, "The User's role", default: :member
      returns CreateUserCommandResult
    end

    expose :authenticate_user do
      desc 'Authenticate a user with credentials'
      implementation AuthenticateUserCommand, :call
      param :login, EmailAddress, "The User's Login", required: true
      param :password, String, "The User's Password", required: true
      returns AuthenticationResult
    end
  end
end

# Usage
result = IdentityProvider::Gateway.create_user(login: 'user@example.com', password: 'secure_password')
```

## Technical Details

### Gateway Characteristics

* Explicit method exposures
* Type-safe parameter definitions
* Command-based implementations
* Rich metadata and documentation

### Communication Strategies

* Synchronous domain interactions
* Explicit interface contracts
* Controlled method exposures

## Design Philosophy

Domainic::Boundary prioritizes:

* Clear domain boundaries
* Minimal implicit dependencies
* Type safety
* Explicit communication patterns
* Architectural modularity

## Dependencies

* Ruby 3.1+
* Optional integration with Domainic::Command
* Optional integration with Domainic::Validation
* Optional integration with Domainic::Type

## Future Considerations

* Async gateway interactions
* Advanced logging and tracing
* Performance optimizations
* Event-driven communication patterns
* Middleware support for gateways

## Performance Considerations

* Lightweight gateway object creation
* Efficient method dispatch
* Minimal runtime overhead
* Lazy parameter validation
* Optimized for complex domain interactions
