## Overview

A feature release focused on enhancing the command execution lifecycle and error handling capabilities. This release
adds powerful features for command composition, validation, and cleanup while maintaining the gem's focus on simplicity
and explicit contracts.

## Confirmed Changes

### 1. Command Lifecycle Callbacks ([#172](https://github.com/domainic/domainic/issues/172))

* Support standard callback points (before/after validation/execution)
* Allow both instance and class level definitions
* Support conditional callbacks
* Enable callback inheritance
* Thread-safe implementation

### 2. Custom Context Validation ([#174](https://github.com/domainic/domainic/issues/174))

* Support custom validation logic for context attributes
* Enable access to full context during validation
* Maintain compatibility with domainic-type
* Provide clear validation error reporting

### 3. Rollback Hooks ([#175](https://github.com/domainic/domainic/issues/175))

* Add rollback support for command failures
* Enable cleanup of partial state changes
* Support different failure scenarios
* Ensure predictable execution order

### 4. Chainable Results ([#176](https://github.com/domainic/domainic/issues/176))

* Add `and_then` support for command chaining
* Enable clean command composition
* Maintain explicit data flow
* Provide clear error handling

### 5. Bug Fixes ([#173](https://github.com/domainic/domainic/issues/173))

* Include docs/USAGE.md in gem package
* Fix gemspec file inclusion

## Release Goals

* Enhance command execution lifecycle
* Improve error handling and recovery
* Enable clean command composition
* Support complex validation scenarios
* Maintain thread safety throughout

## Acceptance Criteria

* [ ] All confirmed changes are implemented
* [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for new features
* [ ] Clear documentation with examples
* [ ] Thread safety validated
* [ ] Performance impact assessed

## Release Preparation Workflow

1. Feature Implementation
2. Documentation Updates
3. Testing & Review
4. Final Release

## Risks & Mitigations

* Risk: Callback complexity impacts performance
  * Mitigation: Benchmark and optimize critical paths
* Risk: Thread safety issues with new features
  * Mitigation: Comprehensive thread safety testing
* Risk: Breaking changes in validation behavior
  * Mitigation: Clear documentation and migration notes

## Open Questions

* Should callbacks be able to modify the command's result?
* How should rollbacks interact with nested command calls?
* What is the performance impact of chained commands?
